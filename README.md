# Team11: Happiness through Food for Disaster Victims

### Project Overview

This project is designed to support disaster victims by addressing food-related challenges and reducing psychological stress through improved meal satisfaction. Our goal is to enhance the overall experience of disaster recovery through accessible, enjoyable, and practical food solutions.

### Background Issues

Disaster victims face:

- Severe mental burden and risk of psychological disorders.
- Limited access to food ingredients and appropriate cooking utensils.
- Dissatisfaction with available meals (e.g., issues like hard-to-chew rice).
- Difficulties due to poor internet connectivity and lack of infrastructure.

### Solution: Cooking Recipe Application

The app helps disaster victims:

- Access easy-to-make recipes tailored for limited resources.
- Search and filter recipes by meal type, available utensils, and offline availability.
- Review and rate recipes, fostering a supportive community.

### Key Features
